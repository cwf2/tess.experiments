tess.experiments

A collection of ongoing work that uses Tesserae to explore the nature of allusion.

INSTALLATION

To use these scripts, you must have Tesserae installed and configured on your system.
(Exception: the 'synonymy' scripts require only the two XML dictionaries, not all of 
Tesserae.)

Create a file in the tess.experiments directory called '.tesserae.conf'.  This file should
consist of a single line, giving the full path to the 'perl/' directory in your Tesserae 
installation: i.e. the directory containing 'TessSystemVars.pm'.

Each of the component projects may have its own further configuration--consult specific
directions within the project directories.
