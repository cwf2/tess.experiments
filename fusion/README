Extra instructions for benchmark.features.pl

I just noticed a couple of bugs in the current version of Tesserae's tf-idf script,
'perl/benchmark/tess-idf.pl'.

 - By default, it's not configured with the rest of Tesserae on install.  You need to
   manually change the comment '# TESS_PATH' to read '# PERL_PATH' and then rerun
   'configure.pl' to fix this.
   
 - By default, it creates the two td-idf score files in the wrong directory.  After running
   'tess-idf.pl' you need to move
   
      data/la.idf_phrase
      data/la.idf_text
      
   to
   
      data/common/
